# BlackjackProject

## Details
This program simulates the card game Blackjack. Two cards are dealt to the player and to the dealer. Only the second card dealt to the dealer is initially visible to the player. If either the player or the dealer has twenty-one points, the game ends immediately. The player is able to hit or stand. Then the dealer draws until he/she has at least seventeen points. Then the program displays the results of the game.
